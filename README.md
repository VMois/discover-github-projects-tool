# Discover how GitHub Projects (beta) are used

In this repository, you can find a list of **158** GitHub organizations
and their publicly available [Projects (beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects).
Each organization in the list has **at least one** repository with **1k+** stars.

In addition, you can also find the script
that was used to collect and generate the list.

The data was queried from GitHub REST and GraphQL APIs, using a personal free account.

## Motivation

By looking into how some organizations are using new Projects to manage their work,
you can get some inspiration for your own project or organization.
